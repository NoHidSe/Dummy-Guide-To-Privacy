## Extensions

Extensions Is A Way To Extend The Usage Of Your Browser One Of My Favorite Extensions Are

- libredirect (redirect website to a libre frontend)

- auto tab discard (Save Ram)

- canvas blocker (canvas blocker)

- multi account container (i love containers)

- Xbrowser Sync (Its Open Source So I Trust It To Sync My Bookmarks)

#### Chrome / Chromium

## Search Engines

stop using google just [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) but if you want google search results you can use [Whoogle](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search) You Can Host It Using Heroku Or Use Their Public Instance

## Libre Frontends Is Sexy
