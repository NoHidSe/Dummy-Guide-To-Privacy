Your PC/Laptop Is The 2nd Most Used Device In Your Lifetime Thats Why You Should Secure It From GoFaMi ( Google, Facebook, Microsoft )

## Windows

- [This Is Win 11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11)

Just Follow The Recommended Settings And You Will Be Just Fine 

### Malware

Some People Think Every Computer Needs An Anti-virus While This Is True But Only True For Old People Or People Who Is Not Tech Savy

Microsoft Defender And Common Sense Is More Than Enough

Or If You're Not Sure You Can Put the File In [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)

But If You Really Need It I Recommend [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)  

## Mac OS

I Don't Really Have A Mac OS VM nor A Computer So I Can't Make  A Guide Without Replicating It And Confirming It (Maybe Other People Could Help With A Pull Request And If Can, Give Evidence thank you)

### Linux

ahh so you have come to the god sent os gnu/linux the land of cli and neofetch, but in a serious note linux is the best os for privacy because Its Open Source And Free (Rather than windows) Plus Bacuse Its Low Market Share It Has Little Known Malware But Still Make Sure To Check It With [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) 

### Distro(s)

There Is A Crap Ton Of Distro Just Check [Its Own Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) But I Recommend 3 OS For Beginners

- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) 
  
  Pros
  
  - Its Debian Based So Its Really Popular
  
  - Based Of Cinnamon Which Look Like Windows 7
  
  Cons
  
  - Stable Release Which Means Its Proably Old Depending On Last Update
  
  - Cant Think Of Anymore Con, Its Really Good For Starters And Simple

- [Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/) 
  
  Pros
  
  - Its Debian
  
  - Based Of Gnome Which Looks Like Mac OS
  
  - Great For Nvidia User Or Gaming In General
  
  Cons
  
  - Stable Release Which Means Its Proably Old Depending On Last Update

- [Endevour OS](https://endeavouros.com/)
  
  Pros
  
  - BTW ARCH
  
  - Comes With Multiple Window Managers That You Can Pick In The GUI
  
  - Rolling Release Which Means Its Always Up To Date
  
  - Great For Gaming Tho You Need To Setup Up Things Like Gamemod And etc
  
  Cons
  
  - Almost Have An Update Every Day
  
  - Need To At least Learn A little of terminal knowledge

- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) 
  
  Pros
  
  - Rolling Release
  
  - Good For Gaming But Need Tweaking
  
  - Uses Gnome
  
  Cons
  
  - Dnf (The Package Manager) is slow unless you tweak it
  
  - Repos Are Not Complete And Have Outdate Packages (With My Experiences)

This 3 Is (In My Opinion) The Best Distro To Use

If Your Distro Of Choice Has A Drive Encryption Setting Enable That For Protection
