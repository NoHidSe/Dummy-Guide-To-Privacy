# Phone Privacy

Your Phone Is The Number 1 Computer You Carry Everyday And Always By Your Side So This Might Be The Guide You Really Need To Do

## Android

Android is one of the best phone os to use for security just don't be stupid and download all apps from the dark deeps of the internet i know you want that clash of clans elixir hack but don't

And Always Update Android OS To The latest For The Latest Security Update

### Google

Lets Talk About The Elephant In The Room Google, Google Is Like The Boogyman In The Privacy community (Second To Facebook) While You Can Remove With Custom Roms But To Be Realistic You Need That For Daily Use Or Banking Apps And etc Will Break (I've Heard [MicroG](https://microg.org/) Re-implementation of Googles Services Is Good but I Haven't Tried It) Plus Custom Roms Is Usually Needs A Xiaomi Or Pixel Or Older Model Phone So No Go With Your New Shiny Phone

### Custom Roms

**Before You Do This Remember You Will Void Your Warenty**

Make Sure You're Phone Is Supported With The Custom Rom

Custom Roms Is A Great Way To Degoogle Your Phone But To Be Realistic Your Average Joe Wont probably Do This, But If You Do It I Would Recommend 2 Roms

[CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) And [Graohene OS](https://grapheneos.org/). Both Are Great At What They Intend To Do

### Bloat

Disgusting Bloat, Bloat Is Like A Plaugue That Leaches To Your Soul Sucking You Dry

Now I Will Show You How To Delete it, [UAD](https://github.com/0x192/Universal-Android-Debloater) Is A Great Way To Delete

Step By Step Guide :

1. Download [UAD](https://github.com/0x192/Universal-Android-Debloater) And ADB (Search "ADB Install On *Insert Your Computer OS*")

2. Turn On USB Debugging (Search "How To Turn On USB Debugging On *Phone Model*" Because Its Diffrent On Every Phone)

3. Just Open It And Start Deleting I Recommend You Stick On The Recommendation Section

### Secure DNS

Secrue Dns Is A Good Way To Protect Your Internet And To Bypass ISP Blocking

I Recommend [Adguard](https://adguard-dns.io/en/welcome.html) And [Cloudflare 1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/dns/) 

To Enable It Go To Settings > connections >  more connection settings > Private DNS

And Just Select Custom

### Apps

Application Is Everything You Use In your Phone Thats Why We Need To Use Apps That We Trust, And Thats Why Open Source Is Great As You Can See The code to Check if there is anything suspicious 

[F-droid](https://f-droid.org/) is A Good Way To Find FOSS (Free And Open Source Software) Apps Things I Recommend Are

- Neo Store (An F-Droid Alternative)

- Aves (A FOSS Gallery With Exif Remover)

- Privacy Camera (Camera With GCam UI Plus And Exif Remover Setting)

- K-9 Mail (A Great Clean Email Client)

- New Pipe (A Completely FOSS Front End Of YouTube)

- Florisboard (A Great FOSS Alternative To GBoard)

- Infinity (Clean Reddit Client)

- Aurora Store (Alternative To Play Store Plus Doesn't Need An Account)

But Be careful Once You Go FOSS You Never Go Back Unless There Is No Alternative With Your Daily Use Apps

### Browser

Browser In Android Has A Crap Ton Of Options But There Is 2 I Recommend Which Is [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) And [Iceraven](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser) Both are Great, Iceraven Is Based Off Firefox Which Has Extension Support So You Can Add Your Favorite Extensions Into You Browser 

### Firewall

Hands Down [Netguard](https://netguard.me/) Is Just Chef Kiss For A Firewall Just Disable All Apps You Think Doesn't Need Wifi Access And DIsable But Enable When Screen On If You Don't Really Care If You get notifications Like Google Apps

## IOS

IOS Proably Is A Fav In The Privacy Community Just One Problem Apple. We Can't Just De-apple Your Iphone But Still A Great OS For Basic Privacy

### Firewall

[Lockdown](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lockdown-privacy-vpn-proxy/id1469783711) Is The Most Popular Firewall In IOS As It Has The Most Features 

### Browsers

Safari Is Great For Privacy As It Has HTTPS As Default But Firefox Is A Good Alternative If You Don't Trust Tim Apple
