# 2FA

2FA Is Great I Love It Religously 

2FA Has Diffrent Types

- MFA

- SMS

- Push Notification

- TOTP

- Hardware Security Keys

MFA, SMS, And Push Notification Is A No Go Please Disable It If You Can Because Even Tho It Securer Than Without It, It Is Still Very Vulnerable.

TOTP Is A Free Way To Secure It
Use [Aegis](https://getaegis.app/) Because Its A Free And Open Source Authenticator
I Don't Recommend Authy Because It Keep Your Secret Code Backed Up In The Cloud And Google Authenticator Because It's google

Hardware Security Keys Is The Best Way To Secure Your Account ( Just Dont Lose It )
[Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/id/store/) is the most popular security key just backup your backup codes in a hidden usb or micro sd so incase you lost the key you can still login to turn off the 2FA
