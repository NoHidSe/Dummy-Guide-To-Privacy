Email Is Like An ID Card And A Password Is Your Face

Its A Way To Differentiate Every Account That Exist In Their Database A Username Can Do That Too But Thats Not The Point 

## A Way To Secure Your Email Is :

### Use A Better Email Provider :

This Can Be Your Secondary Email For Other Things You Want To Be Very Secure

There Is A Lot Of Email Providers But The Most Popular Is [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) Because It's Free But If You Have A Bit Of Money You Could Use [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/pricing) 

### Use A Email Aliasing Service :

While Having Another Email Is Great But Realistically We're Just Lazy To Check 2 Emails So We Use An Alternative Which Is Email Aliasing Basically they Gave You An Email That You Can Use Anywhere And Any Mail That The Email Receive It Forwards It Tu Your Real Email  And You Can Disable Or Even Delete The Email If You Login In A Scam Or Spam Website

Email Aliasing Services That Is Good ( And Free ) Is  [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) And [Simple Login](https://simplelogin.io/) 

Both Are Great And Really Simple To Use ( But AnonAddy Has Unlimited Standard Aliases But I Haven't Tried It Yet Will Update If I Ever Try It )

### Always Secure It With 2FA

2FA Is Great Always Enable It In Every Website It Supports It Including Email Or Email Aliasing Services In [2FA](./2FA.md) I Talk About 2FA In More Detail
