Just Don't Use [Lastpass](https://debugger.medium.com/you-need-a-password-manager-just-dont-use-lastpass-4b4ef3d485f)  

### Use A Strong Password

A Strong Password Is The Key ( No Pun Intended ) To A Good And Secure Account 

If You Use One Of The Three Password Manager I Gave You Don't Need A Password Generator Because It Already Has A Good Password Manager Just Use All The Settings Like Special Characters And Numbers ( If The Website Supports It ) And Put It On The Maximum Length That The Website Can Accept For Maximum Security
